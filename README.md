# Gnolo project by Team-11

## What's Gnolo projet ?

This projet is a challenge given to learners @BeCode WebDev Formation.

It consists to design a mini rpg game on browser using javascript.

The challenge is to do it by team of 2 persons.

## Technologies used

For this projet, all ressources learned can be used so, we used them.

* ### HTML

Only for the structure of the page.

* ### CSS 

For the styling page and structured grid / flex.

* ### SASS 

To make CSS more easier (variables and includes usage).

* ### Javascript
 
For the entire application behind the webpage.

## Organisation

* ### Fabian Quoidbach & Mikye Rinaldo

They both works on the entire script.
One on some stuff and the other working on other.
Or by pair coding.

## Result

At the beginning, it was difficult to organize work properly, but finally, we are proud to show you what we have done in one week.
